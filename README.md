# AbstractClassPractice

Abstraction means highlighting the services and we do not have the implementation. 

## There are two types of methods:

1) Normal methods
  
  Normal methods is when we declare the methods and have the implementation( logics).
  
  
  
  2) Abstract methods

  Abstract methods is when we only declare the methods. We do not have the implementation. We use the abstract modifier in the abstract method. 
  
  It ends with semicolan. It implementation will be in the child class. The child class extends the child class. So, Abstraction has Inheritance and
  
  overriding / overriden concept.
  
  
  ## Two types of classes:
  
  1) Normal classes

    Normal classes contain the normal methods. 
    
    Normal methods is when we declare the methods and have the implementation( logics). 
    
    
    2) Abstract classes
    
    Abstract classes contain abstract methods. Abstract methods is when we only declare the methods. 
    
    To make the class abstract we use the abstract modifier in the class.
    
    
    We cannot create the object of abstract classes.
